This can include an Enterprise Project, Project, Task, Document, Supplier, or Portfolio.",TOOLTIP_MATRIX_CONFIGURATION:"The configuration connected with the context.

Default values are 1-Negligible, 2-Minor, 3-Moderate, 4-Major, or 5-High. To define other values, you can customize the Matrix Configuration.",TOOLTIP_PROBABILITY:"The probability of the risk occurring.

For example, using the default values, an Impact of '2' and Probability of '4' results in a calculated risk level of 2 in the risk matrix configuration. Therefore, the Severity is displayed as '2-Medium'.

Cells having a pattern are within the goal's limit. The goal is represented by a circle; the current rating has a check mark. A check mark inside the circle indicates that the goal and the rating are the same.
